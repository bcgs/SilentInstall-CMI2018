# SilentInstall-CMI2018

Batch script for silent installation of default softwares (Windows only).

# How to use

Simply drag n' drop both ```script.bat``` and ```_default_``` folder to whatever directory you want. Once it's done just go ahead and run the script **as administrator** and *voil√†*.  
The script is self-destructive. After the installation process you'll no longer see neither the script nor the folder. Better keep a copy of both on a pendrive.
